# lalit_laptop_price_predictor

Description
 -This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict laptop prices based on various features such as brand, specifications, and user ratings. It was implemented as part of an academic project to gain hands-on experience 
  with machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

Features
- Data preprocessing to clean and transform raw data into a suitable format for model training.
- Implementation of multiple regression algorithms to predict laptop prices.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- Visualization of data insights and model results using Matplotlib.
